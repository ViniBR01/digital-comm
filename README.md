# Digital Communication Systems

tl;dr: Non-optimal implementation of a digital communication system.
The goal of this project is to learn how to do it in a proper way.

This project doesn't have a time frame to be completed, and will evolve as my learning interests change. 

## Goal

This project is intended to be an ever evolving experimental ground to learn and experiment with digital communication systems.

The initial target is to build an end-to-end implementation of a communication system from the input of a data stream into a Tx side to the output of the decoded message stream on the Rx side.
The inspiration will come from the 3gpp and 802.11 standards. If all goes well we will end up with an implementation that is capable of over-the-air communication, although I don't plan to actually implement the RF front-end part. The scope of this project is from the input/output of data to the DAC/ADC interfaces.

## Topics that will be covered

-Digital communication systems
-Digital signal processing
-Embedded systems
-C/C++
-Test and debugging
-Instrumentation and performance evaluation
